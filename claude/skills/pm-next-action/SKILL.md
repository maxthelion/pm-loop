name: pm-next-action
description: Run one iteration of the roadmap PM behaviour tree. Refreshes docs/roadmap/next-actions.md, executes the Next Agent Item via the pm-assistant subagent, commits the result, and surfaces any user-attention items. Pair with /loop for an autonomous PM heartbeat. Exits cleanly when only user-input items remain.

# PM Next Action

## The split

This is the roadmap-PM counterpart of `/next-action`. Selector and executor are deliberately separated so only the expensive part uses an LLM:

1. **`scripts/roadmap/next-roadmap-actions.sh`** — pure bash. Reads each `docs/roadmap/<feature-slug>/` directory and the front matter in its `README.md`. Picks the first missing artifact per feature (`blocked → notes → user-stories → existing-state → prototypes/* → ux-review → spec → plan → ready`). Writes `docs/roadmap/next-actions.md`.

2. **This skill (`/pm-next-action`)** — LLM. Reads `next-actions.md`. Dispatches the `pm-assistant` subagent against the **Next Agent Item** if there is one. Commits via `commit-roadmap-action.sh`. Surfaces blocked items via `attention-summary.sh`. Exits.

Under `/loop`, the pattern is:

```
loop iteration:
  → next-roadmap-actions.sh writes docs/roadmap/next-actions.md
  → /pm-next-action reads it, dispatches pm-assistant if there is an agent item, commits, exits
next iteration:
  → next-roadmap-actions.sh re-evaluates against the new state
  → ...
```

Process reference: `docs/working-through-a-roadmap.md`. Sub-agent contract: `.claude/agents/pm-assistant.md`.

## How to invoke

- `/pm-next-action` — manual single iteration. Refreshes the selector first, then runs at most one PM action.
- `/loop 10m /pm-next-action` — continuous PM heartbeat, matching the cadence described in `docs/working-through-a-roadmap.md` § "Active Heartbeat Automation".

## What this skill does

1. **Refresh the selector.** Run `scripts/roadmap/next-roadmap-actions.sh`. This rewrites `docs/roadmap/next-actions.md` against current state.
2. **Read `docs/roadmap/next-actions.md`.** Locate the `## Next Agent Item` section and capture: item id, feature title, slug, action verb, reason, suggested output. The selector ranks unresolved user feedback and review rework ahead of ordinary artifact creation, even when the affected item appears later in backlog order.
3. **Decide whether to act.**
   - If the section says "No roadmap items currently have an autonomous PM-assistant action" → run `scripts/roadmap/attention-summary.sh`, report what is blocking, exit. Do **not** commit.
   - Otherwise → continue to step 4.
4. **Dispatch `pm-assistant`.** Use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: pm-assistant`. The brief must be self-contained: include the feature slug, action verb, reason from the selector, and the suggested-output guidance verbatim. Tell the agent to follow its own action contract in `.claude/agents/pm-assistant.md` and to return the standard report format (`DONE` / `BLOCKED` / `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` plus changed paths).
5. **Apply the result.**
   - If `pm-assistant` reports `DONE` and wrote files under `docs/roadmap/`, run `scripts/roadmap/commit-roadmap-action.sh`. The helper already filters pure `next-actions.md` churn so a no-op refresh does not produce a commit.
   - If `pm-assistant` reports `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, confirm it wrote or updated `concerns.md`, then run `scripts/roadmap/commit-roadmap-action.sh`. The next selector run will surface the item under "Next User Item" as `review-concerns`.
   - If `pm-assistant` reports `BLOCKED`, the agent will have written `open-questions.md` and updated front matter. The commit helper still applies; the next selector run will surface the item under "Next User Item".
6. **Refresh and surface attention.** Rerun `scripts/roadmap/next-roadmap-actions.sh` so the post-action state is reflected. Then run `scripts/roadmap/attention-summary.sh` and include its output in the final response.
7. **Exit.** Do not chain into a second action. The next loop iteration evaluates from scratch.

## Action verbs (handled by `pm-assistant`)

The selector emits one of these verbs. Definitions and per-action contracts live in `.claude/agents/pm-assistant.md`; this list is here as a sanity check, not as the canonical roster.

| Verb | Artifact written | Loop role |
|---|---|---|
| `clarify-feature` | (none — needs user) | **Skipped by this skill.** Surfaces via attention summary. |
| `address-feedback` | affected roadmap artifact plus handled `feedback/*.md` front matter | `pm-assistant` |
| `draft-user-stories` | `user-stories.md` or `open-questions.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `inspect-existing-state` | `existing-state.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `build-prototypes` | `prototypes/*` | `pm-assistant` (HTML wireframes only; must read notes, stories, existing-state, feedback, and any redirecting UX review) |
| `write-architecture` | `architecture.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `write-implementation-handoff` | `implementation-handoff.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `write-spec` | `spec.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `write-plan` | `plan.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `review-prototypes` | `ux-review.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `review-architecture` | `architecture-review.md` | `pm-assistant` |
| `review-concerns` | (none — needs user review first) | **Skipped by this skill.** User decides whether concerns become guardrails, questions, or resolved notes. |
| `ready-for-build-queue` | (none — promotion is a user decision) | **Skipped by this skill.** Use `scripts/roadmap/promote-ready-item-to-worktree.sh <item-id>` when the user explicitly promotes it. |
| `blocked` | (none) | **Skipped by this skill.** |

If the selector emits a verb that is not `pm-assistant`'s (`clarify-feature`, `blocked`, `review-concerns`, `ready-for-build-queue`), this skill exits without dispatching. Those need a human.

## Loop boundary — do not cross

This skill is the PM loop. It must not become an implementation loop.

- **Edits only `docs/roadmap/**`.** The `pm-assistant` agent is already write-scoped to that directory; do not relax that.
- **No production code, tests, wiki, or `docs/specs/` / `docs/plans/` writes.** Promotion to the build queue is an explicit user-driven step handled outside this skill by `scripts/roadmap/promote-ready-item-to-worktree.sh`.
- **No `.claude/state/` writes.** That namespace belongs to the implementation BT (`/next-action`). The two trees share no state files.
- **Commits stay under `docs/roadmap/`.** Use `scripts/roadmap/commit-roadmap-action.sh` — it stages `docs/roadmap/**` only and skips empty refresh-only changes.

## Safety rails

- **One action per invocation.** No chaining. The next selector run picks the next item.
- **No-churn under /loop.** If there is no Next Agent Item, exit before dispatching anything. The selector refresh + attention summary are cheap and idempotent; nothing else runs.
- **No human interaction in the loop.** If `pm-assistant` returns `BLOCKED`, that is the expected handoff to the user — the open-questions file plus the next attention summary are the user's notification. Exit cleanly.
- **Stop on uncertainty.** If `next-actions.md` cannot be parsed or `pm-assistant` returns an unexpected status, exit with a short report. Do not improvise past the agent's contract.

## Final report format

End the response with two short blocks:

```
PM action: <verb> on item <id> <title> — <DONE|BLOCKED|DONE_WITH_CONCERNS|skipped>
<one-line description of what was written or why nothing ran>

<output of scripts/roadmap/attention-summary.sh>
```

Keep it tight. The diff is the source of truth; this skill should not produce a wall of summary text.
